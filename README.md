# NPM, React, SASS Starter

This is essentially an starter framework for a React project using NodeJs as a watcher and SASS to compile css.  Javascript uses Webpack and Babel to compile Javascript so that it can be read in the browser.  In addtion both Javascript and SCSS are minified for performance reasons.

Three commands can be used to start the watcher:

1.   ```npm run watch```
⋅⋅⋅Watches both Javascript and SASS

2.   ```npm run watch:js```
⋅⋅⋅Watches Javascript

3.  ```npm run watch:scss```
⋅⋅⋅Watches SASS
